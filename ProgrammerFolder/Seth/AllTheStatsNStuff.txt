Notes on current game/design features in frogger:

1. each row spawns the same speed/patterened cars, logs, ect.
2. you get 10 points ever time you manage to move north (*none when you go back and forth - only redeemable per row).
3. There are turtles that go underwater, there are 2 phases prior to them going underwater - you can stay on top as long as they aren't underwater.
4. when the timer climbs down from 40 seconds and you are still on the same level it will kill you automatically.
5. As long as you hit the boxcollider of the enemy you will die - you don't even need to necessarily be "touching" the art for the sprite to die.
6. Generally the first couple car lanes run relatively slowly.
7. As you get farther down and closer to the endpoint the enemies will be faster.
8. Your death animation contains 3 different sprites, and leaves a temporary skull and cross.
9. All in all you have around 2 minutes (*because you have 3 lives) to get all the frogs in the water spots (*5).
10. There is a 'slight' delay between movements, but it moves pretty fast.

frames/speed of individual items in the game:

CARS:
1. approximate cube/unit width - 48 pixels ; approximate cube/unit height - 48 pixels.
2. 1st car row [pixels per second] ~ 48p/1.35s
3. 2nd car row [pixels per second] ~ 48p/1.04s
4. 3rd car row [pixels per second] ~ 48p/.84s
5. 4th car row [pixels per second] ~ 48p/.66s
6. 5th car row [pixels per second] ~ 48p/(1.17/2)s [this one is a truck, so it had the length of 2]

NOTE: any time is approximated from the end of a car spawn to the very start of another, probably +- .5s for the rates.
---[pls note that the truck is 2 spaces long]---
7. 1st car row ~ spawn rate + pattern - 1u/4.69s(*short spawn) | 1u/6.56s(*medium spawn) | 1u/9.56s(*long spawn) DESCRIPTION: spawns: medium/short/long [direction--> left]
8. 2nd car row ~ spawn rate + pattern - 1u/4.15s(*short spawn) | 1u/5.76s(*medium spawn) | 1u/9.15s(*long spawn) DESCRIPTION: spawns: medium/short/long [direction--> right] 
9. 3rd car row ~ spawn rate + pattern - 1u/3.51s(*short spawn) | 1u/7.72s(*long spawn) DESCRIPTION: spawns: short/short/long [direction--> left]
10. 4th car row ~ spawn rate + pattern - 1u/11.84s(*super-long spawn) DESCRIPTION: spawns: super-long [direction--> right]
11. 5th car row ~ spawn rate + pattern - 1u/3.62s(*short spawn) | 1u/6.61s(*long spawn) DESCRIPTION: spawns: short/long [direction--> left]

LOGS/TURLES:
1. approximate cube/unit width - 48 pixels ; approximate cube/unit height - 48 pixels.
2. 1st log row [pixels per second] ~ 48p/1.84s
3. 2nd log row [pixels per second] ~ 48p/2s
4. 3rd log row [pixels per second] ~ 48p/1.92s
5. 4th log row [pixels per second] ~ 48p/0.68s
6. 5th log row [pixels per second] ~ 48p/2.07s

NOTE: any time is approximated from the end of a log/turtle spawn to the very start of another, probably +- .5s for the rates.
---[pls note that many of the logs are mutliple untits long]---
7. 1st car row ~ spawn rate + pattern - 1u/1.1s(*short spawn) DESCRIPTION: spawns: short [direction--> left]
8. 2nd car row ~ spawn rate + pattern - 1u/3.2s(*short spawn) | 1u/4.26s(*medium spawn) DESCRIPTION: spawns: medium/short [direction--> right] 
9. 3rd car row ~ spawn rate + pattern - 1u/1.63s(*short spawn) DESCRIPTION: spawns: short [direction--> right]
10. 4th car row ~ spawn rate + pattern - 1u/15s(*short spawn) DESCRIPTION: spawns: short [direction--> left]
11. 5th car row ~ spawn rate + pattern - 1u/.87s(*short spawn) | 1u/1.67(*medium spawn) DESCRIPTION: spawns: medium/medium/short [direction--> right]
